## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Usage reporting to the maintainers' trace service: a `startup` event (program name and version only) once per process and a `backup-completed` event (nothing else) when a backup run finishes, sent from a background thread that never delays a backup or holds up exit by more than the client's 5-second timeout. Nothing about the users, organizations or repositories being backed up is sent. On by default; a one-line notice is logged the first time it runs on a machine (recorded in `~/.config/gh-backup/usage-reporting-notice-shown`), and it is turned off with `-Dusage.reporting.enabled=false` or `USAGE_REPORTING_ENABLED=false` (`usage.reporting.endpoint` and `usage.reporting.key` are documented in `CONFIG.md`; the Docker daemon takes `USAGE_REPORTING_ENABLED` from `.env`)
- `TraceClient`, the [trace-client-java](https://github.com/Stephenson-Software/trace-client-java) client, vendored unmodified apart from its package line as `com.github.backup.trace.TraceClient` together with its tests
- `BACKUP_INTERVAL_MS` environment variable for the Docker daemon image, mapped by `docker-entrypoint.sh` to `-Dbackup.scheduled.interval.ms`, so the backup interval can be configured from `.env`/`docker-compose.yml` without overriding the entrypoint
- `docker-entrypoint-test.sh`, a shell test that runs `docker-entrypoint.sh` against a stub `java` and asserts the argument list built for each combination of `BACKUP_DIRECTORY`, `SCHEDULED_USERS` and `BACKUP_INTERVAL_MS`, including empty values and values containing spaces; it runs in the `docker-build` CI job, so entrypoint changes are no longer merged unexecuted

### Fixed

- Documentation accuracy: the `java -jar` examples in `README.md`, `USER_GUIDE.md` and `CONFIG.md` now name `target/gh-backup-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-8-8-2026.jar`, the artifact the build actually produces, instead of the non-existent `target/gh-backup-1.0.0.jar`

## [2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-8-8-2026] – 2026-08-08

### Changed
- gh-backup is now developed AI-first. Day-to-day feature work, grooming, review and maintenance run through AI agents working directly against this repository, with the maintainers setting direction and approving what lands. The major version bump marks that change in how the project is built — it is not a break in behaviour, configuration or stored data, and existing installations can upgrade in place. Released as `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-8-8-2026`: the AI-first line has not yet been verified in live operation, and the dated snapshot designation stays until it has.

### Added

- Daemon mode (`-Dspring.profiles.active=daemon`): runs scheduled backups automatically for configured users/organizations at a configurable interval (`backup.scheduled.users`, `backup.scheduled.interval.ms`), defaulting to every 24 hours
- Docker support (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`) for running daemon mode as a containerized background service

### Fixed

- Documentation accuracy: the `--interactive` flag, the `quit` command alias, the `backup.progress.overwrite` and `logging.level.root` properties, the Docker environment variables, the web API error responses, and the anonymous fallback for an invalid `GITHUB_TOKEN` are now documented, and the repository links in `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` point at `Stephenson-Software/gh-backup`

## [1.0.0] – 2026-01-01

### Added

- CLI mode: back up public repositories for one or more GitHub users or organizations by passing their names as arguments
- Interactive mode (`-i`/`--interactive` flag): prompt-based interface with `backup`, `status`, `help`, and `exit` commands
- Web UI mode (`-Dspring.profiles.active=web`): browser-based interface for managing backups
- REST API endpoints (`POST /api/backups`, `GET /api/backups/status`) for programmatic access
- GitHub authentication via `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for higher API rate limits
- Configurable backup directory via `backup.directory` system property (defaults to `~/gh-backups/`)
- Cross-platform path normalization (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Backing up multiple users and organizations in a single invocation, processed one after another
- Incremental updates: existing repositories are updated with `git fetch` instead of re-cloned
