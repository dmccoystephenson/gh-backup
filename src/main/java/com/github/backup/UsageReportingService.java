/**
 * Reports that gh-backup was used, to the trace service, and never gets in the
 * way of a backup.
 *
 * <p>Two events are sent, both off the calling thread through the vendored
 * {@link TraceClient}: {@code startup} once per process (tagged with the
 * program version only) and {@code backup-completed} when a backup run
 * finishes, with no tags at all. Nothing identifying is sent: no user or
 * organization names, no repository names, no counts, no paths, no hostnames.
 *
 * <p>Reporting is on by default and switched off with
 * {@code usage.reporting.enabled=false} (as a {@code -D} system property, in
 * {@code application.properties}, or as {@code USAGE_REPORTING_ENABLED=false}
 * in the environment). The first time reporting runs on a machine, one
 * notice is logged saying so; a marker file under the user's config directory
 * ({@code ~/.config/gh-backup/}) keeps it from being repeated. gh-backup has
 * no settings file of its own, which is why a marker file is used.
 *
 * <p>Every path through this class is exception-safe: a bad endpoint, an
 * unwritable home directory or an unreachable trace server leave the backup
 * untouched.
